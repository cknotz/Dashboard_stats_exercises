## Step 1: Install `R` & `RStudio`

To be able to run the simulation on your own computer you need to install `R` and `RStudio`. Both are **open source** and **free**.

You can download `R` from https://cran.uib.no/index.html and `RStudio` from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Install the free Desktop version of `RStudio`.

If you like, you can also watch the following two videos that will guide you through the installation process:

* Install `R`: https://vimeo.com/203516510
* Install `RStudio`: https://vimeo.com/203516968

## Step 2: Download the code file from *CANVAS*

The code for the simulation is contained in the `clt_sim_app.R` file, which you can download from the course page on *CANVAS*. 

Download the file and save it somewhere where you can easily find it (e.g., the Desktop).

## Step 3: Open `RStudio` & maintenance

Once you have installed both `R` and `RStudio`, open `RStudio`. 

In `RStudio`, use the menu at the top to open the `clt_sim_app.R` file:

1. Go to `File`
2. Go to `Open file...`
3. Navigate to where you stored the `clt_sim_app.R` file and open it.

## Step 4: Installing packages

Once you open the file in `RStudio`, a little banner will appear at the top warning you that some packages need to be installed. Click on `Install` to install these packages automatically.

**Wait** until the installation is complete.

## Step 5: Run the simulation

If you look toward the menu bar in the upper part of your screen, you can see a button saying `Run App` (see also the image on the next page).

Click on this button to start the simulation. Ignore the orange warning messages in the bottom left window (yes, really). Feel free to look at the code, but do not change it (unless you happen to know what you are doing).
