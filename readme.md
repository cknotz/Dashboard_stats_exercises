### Shiny dashboard featuring statistics & R exercises

This repository contains code for an interactive statistics dashboard and interactive tutorials for R.

The statistics dashboard works by generating random data from which students can then compute some statistics and statistical tests, e.g. the mean and variance of a variable or the correlation coefficient between two variables. Students are provided with the correct solution and can access a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how the solution is calculated.

The interactive R tutorials are designed with `learnr`.

This is work in progress!
