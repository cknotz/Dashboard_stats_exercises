### Shiny dashboard featuring statistics exercises

This is an interactive dashboard featuring exercises for an introductory statistics course. The dashboard generates random data from which students can then compute some statistics and statistical tests, e.g. the mean and variance of a variable or the correlation coefficient between two variables. Students are provided with the correct solution and can access a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how the solution is calculated.

This is work in progress!
